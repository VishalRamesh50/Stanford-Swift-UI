# Stanford Swift UI (cs193p)
All the code written while following along with the [Stanford iOS Application Development cs193p](https://cs193p.sites.stanford.edu/) course online.

Each pull request has information about what I've learned from each lecture or assignment, the new features added to the app/tasks completed, and pictures or GIFs of how the final product looks.

_I have not finished the course yet._
